The Real-Time Face Emotion Detection System is an innovative project designed to detect and classify human emotions through live camera feeds with an accuracy of approximately 90%. This system leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for deep learning, alongside essential libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and OpenCV for real-time image processing. The system accurately identifies various emotions including happy, sad, neutral, surprise, and angry by analyzing facial expressions in real-time. This advanced technology has a wide range of applications, enhancing user experiences in areas such as customer service, mental health monitoring, interactive entertainment, and any scenario requiring emotion-based interaction. By implementing this system, we provide a robust tool that not only improves the interaction between humans and machines but also adds significant value to user engagement and satisfaction.
